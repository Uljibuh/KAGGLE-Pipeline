## Types of Machine learning Algorithms
​
1. Supervised Learning: Input data is called training data and
has a known label or result.
Ex: Spam/not-spam or a stock price at a time.
​
2. Unsupervised Learning: Input data is not labeled and does
not have a known result.
EX: Grouping customers by purchasing behavior
​
3. Semi-Supervised Learning: Input data is a mixture of labeled and
unlabeled examples.
EX: a photo archive where only some of the
images are labeled, (e.g. dog, cat, person) and the majority are
unlabeled.
​
4. Reinforcement Learning: a goal-oriented learning based
on interaction with environment. Autonomous cars.



## Supervised Machine Learning
1. Regression: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression

2. Instance-based Algorithms: k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)

3. Decision Tree Algorithms: CART

4. Bayesian Algorithms: Naive Bayes

5. Ensemble Algorithms: eXtreme Gradient Boosting

6. Deep Learning Algorithms: Convolution Neural Network



## Classification vs Regression
**Classification** predicting a label .vs. **Regression** predicting a quantity.


## Classification Algorithms Examples:
- Linear: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression
- Nonlinear: Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors
- Ensemble:
    - Bagging: Random Forest
    - Boosting:  AdaBoost
